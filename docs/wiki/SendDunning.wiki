<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

In order to send out a dunning, the original invoice you want to dun must be sent out via !SendRegning.no. The original invoice must also be in the state `dueDecide`.

You can also find more information about when you can add to dunning fee/interest [http://www.sendregning.no/loven-om-purregebyr-og-renter/index.jsp here]

== Delivery method ==

A dunning must be printed out and sent to the recipient by paper mail.

The reason for this is the wording in the Act relating to overdue payments, which says:

 Demand can be sent electronically if the debtor has expressly accepted the use of such communication.

The Norwegian Consumer Council says the following about this:

 The Norwegian Consumer Council is in doubt whether it is desirable that demands can be sent electronically, even if the debtor has expressly accepted this.

The lawyers/auditors we have had contact with regarding this, say quite clearly that if there is to be some weight to the demand, a dunning should be sent on paper.

== Example of the smallest possible XML for sending out a dunning ==
{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<dunnings>
  <dunning>
    <invoiceNo>100453</invoiceNo>
  </dunning>
</dunnings>
}}}

Your invoice with number 100453 will now be dunned with no dunning fee or interest. Since it isn't sent out a dunning for this invoice before, it will be 1st DUNNING and the dunning text will be "Vi kan dessverre ikke se å ha mottatt Deres betaling for denne regning." with 14 due days.

== Example of sending out a dunning with dunning fee, interest, 21 due days and a custom message ==
{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<dunnings>
  <dunning>
    <invoiceNo>100453</invoiceNo>
    <dunningFee>true</dunningFee>
    <interest>true</interest>
    <dunningDays>21</dunningDays>
    <dunningText>Kjære kunde, vennligst betal utestående beløp</dunningText>
  </dunning>
</dunnings>
}}}
